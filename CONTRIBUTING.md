2. Clone your fork: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/toggo.git`
3. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/my-new-feature`
4. Make your changes
5. Run tests: `go test ./...`
6. Commit your changes: `git commit -am 'Add new feature'`
7. Push to the branch: `git push origin feature/my-new-feature`
8. Submit a pull request

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.21 or higher
- Git

### Building

```bash
go build ./...
```

### Running Tests

Run all tests:
```bash
go test ./...
```

Run tests with coverage:
```bash
go test -cover ./...
```

Run tests with race detector:
```bash
go test -race ./...
```

Generate coverage report:
```bash
go test -coverprofile=coverage.out ./...
go tool cover -html=coverage.out -o coverage.html
```

## Code Style

- Follow the [Effective Go](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go) guidelines
- Use `gofmt` to format your code
- Run `go vet` to check for common mistakes
- Add comments for exported functions, types, and constants
- Write descriptive commit messages

## Testing Guidelines

- Write tests for all new features
- Maintain or improve code coverage
- Test edge cases and error conditions
- Use table-driven tests where appropriate
- Ensure all tests pass before submitting PR

Example test structure:
```go
func TestFeature(t *testing.T) {
    tests := []struct {
        name     string
        input    string
        expected string
    }{
        {"case1", "input1", "output1"},
        {"case2", "input2", "output2"},
    }
    
    for _, tt := range tests {
        t.Run(tt.name, func(t *testing.T) {
            result := Feature(tt.input)
            if result != tt.expected {
                t.Errorf("expected %v, got %v", tt.expected, result)
            }
        })
    }
}
```

## Pull Request Guidelines

- Keep PRs focused on a single feature or fix
- Update documentation for API changes
- Add tests for new functionality
- Ensure all tests pass
- Update CHANGELOG.md (if applicable)
- Reference related issues in the PR description

## Commit Message Format

Use clear, descriptive commit messages:

```
<type>: <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

Types:
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `test`: Test additions or changes
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `perf`: Performance improvements
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

Example:
```
feat: add regex operator support

Add support for regex pattern matching in conditions.
This allows users to match attributes against regular expressions.

Closes #123
```

## Adding New Features

When adding new features:

1. Check if an issue exists, or create one
2. Discuss the feature in the issue before implementing
3. Write tests first (TDD approach recommended)
4. Implement the feature
5. Update documentation
6. Add examples if applicable
